# pollution-prediction

Self-directed exploration of classical machine learning algorithms for HMC's CS189 Programming Practicum elective. Particular focus was given to regression algorithms, as I was working with continuous variables. 

Project goal: understand how classical machine learning algorithms work, and apply them to predict air pollution levels on the ground, based on weather data and satellite observations of pollutants. Dataset from [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/zindiweekendz-learning-urban-air-pollution-challenge).

Future areas of exploration: algorithms that can operate on time series data to take advantage of time and location features (rather than treating data as independent entries in a table).
